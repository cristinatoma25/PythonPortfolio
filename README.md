# PythonPortfolio

Hello!

You are currently reading the ReadMe file of my python projects portfolio.
This repository contains projects that I have been working on for the last year, maybe a while more. Most of the projects you will find here will be beginner friendly.

I am a graduate engineering student and, regarding programming, most of my experience contains Python (data analisys, web development, GUI development), Arduino (robotics and mechatronics projects), C++, SQL and in future add-ons I would like to extend my performances to automation and, most preferably, the development of autonomous or semi-autonomous devices. Most of the projects that are under development at the moment would be summarised by this statement: The use of IoT and Machine Learning to upgrade your home environment. 

Later this week I would like to also upload a few of my arduino projects in a separate repository, you will find the link towards that right here when it is ready.

Have a wonderful day and happy coding! :)
